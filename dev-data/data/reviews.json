The Miami Seaquarium was the highlight for the kids, and the Bayside Marketplace had lots of shops for us adults to enjoy. It was a great family day out!",

    "review": "Both Telluride and Vail are stunning, and the views alone were worth the trip. Telluride offers a more laid-back and scenic experience, while Vail has a bigger, bustling ski scene. The only downside was the weather on one of the days, which limited skiing, but the tour still made up for it with scenic drives and cozy stops. It’s definitely a must-do for skiers looking for a two-town experience!",

We got to visit some of Las Vegas's most glamorous resorts, including The Venetian, Caesars Palace, and The Bellagio, and even had time for a Michelin-starred dinner. The tour guide was excellent and gave us insider tips on how to make the most of our time in Vegas. It was a classy and well-organized way to see the best of what Las Vegas has to offer.",

We visited Venice Beach, Laguna Beach, and Old Town San Diego, all in one day, which was a lot to fit in. The drive along Pacific Coast Highway was beautiful, but I would have loved more time to stop and explore some of the smaller towns like Dana Point or Carlsbad. Still, it was a great trip and a fantastic way to see a lot in a short amount of time.!",

The drive from Big Bend to Carlsbad Caverns took several hours, and the road to White Sands felt like it went on forever. However, the rewards of seeing such unique locations like White Sands and Guadalupe Mountains made it all worth it. If you don’t mind long stretches of driving, you’ll be rewarded with unforgettable sights.",

Then, we went to Vail, where you get the upscale ski resort vibe with excellent dining and shopping. The tour allowed time for both skiing and exploring each town’s unique character. A perfect trip for anyone who loves a good combination of history, culture, and skiing.",
